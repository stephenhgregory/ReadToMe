# ReadToMe
### Summer 2021

## Abstract
ReadToMe is an application for audiobooks that uses voice cloning to imitate the voices of celebrities as well as family & friends, allowing users to hear books come to life from a voice of their choosing. ReadToMe uses state-of-the-art deep neural networks to perform voice cloning, and only needs a short audio sample (< 10 minutes of speaking) to effectively clone a personâ€™s voice. The engineering and creation of this project necessitates the use of the following technologies:
- Deep Neural Network Theory (Autoencoders, CNNs, T)
- Math (Calculus, Statistics)
- AWS (S3, Lambda)
- Python (Object Oriented Programming)
- TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Django
- UI/UX Design


## Goals
- Create the neural network and algorithm needed to perform voice cloning - Jun. 20th
- Integrate the neural network into a web server, hostable on AWS - July 5th
- Create an API to invoke neural network for voice cloning - July 15th
  - Input: Text
  - Output: Audio
- Option: - July 31st
  - Code a simple iOS application in Swift to interface with app
  - Create a simple web application in Django
